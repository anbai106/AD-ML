This subdirectory contains the guideline and steps to reproduce the experiments in the specific paper **Reproducible evaluation of diffusion MRI features for automatic classification of patients with Alzheimerâ€™s disease** using diffusion MRI from ADNI dataset [ADNI](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/). It is developed by the [ARAMIS Lab](http://www.aramislab.fr).

We assume that you have installed all the dependencies of [Clinica software platform](http://www.clinica.run) and downloaded the ADNI original data.

# Go back to paper version of Clinica software

The commandline to go back to the specific git commit of the paper:
```
bash 1-go_back_to_paper_version_clinica.sh
```

# Convert the original ADNI data into BIDS format

The original ADNI data should be downloaded without further touch (Data we used in our paper was downloaded in October 2016). 

The commandline to convert the data automatically:
```
bash 2-ADNI_conversion.sh
```

# Create the subjects lists

The script to choose the subjects available at baseline for diffusion MRI:
```
python 3-create_subjects_list.py
```

# Create the demographic table information

The script to get demographic information based on the chosen population:
```
python 4-population_statistics.py
```

# Run image processing pipelines

The fist two pipelines were partly integrated into Clinica software and a postprocesing python script was also developed.

Runs these pipelines sequentially:

```
bash 5-ADNI_preprocessing.sh
```

```
bash 6-ADNI_processing.sh
```

```
python 7-ADNI_postprocessing.py
```

# Run classification tasks

The scripts to obtain the results of the experiments from the paper are as follows:

Classification results of original data on T1-weighted and diffusion MRI:

```
python 8-ADNI_classification_original_data.py
```

Classification results of balanced data on diffusion MRI:

```
python 9-ADNI_classification_balanced_data.py
```

Classification results of feature selection bias on diffusion MRI:

```
python 10-ADNI_classification_feature_selection.py
```
